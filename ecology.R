# Course: Data Analysis and Statistics
# Data Analysis Final Assignment

# This script is to investigate how the availability and variability of resources affect the individual
# fitness, the total reproductive output and the age of female Orcas at death. The investigation
# seeks to support a better understanding of the effect of the environment on both the fitness
# of an individual Orca and the reproductive ability of an entire Orca population.
# The investigation will be done by means of a simulation programmed in R. You will gradually
# build up and then run a simulation of the reproductive life histories of thousands of female
# Orcas that allows you to generate data that can be analyzed with respect to the given
# research objective
